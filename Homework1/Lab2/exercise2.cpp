/* Write a program for the IRS that will calculate income tax. You will need as input the personâ€™s
annual salary.
This year you paid $_______ dollars in
tax. So your net salary after taxes are taken out is $________.

*******************
Extra Credit:
Ask the user if he/she has any children.
If they do have children, ask them how many, and calculate their new tax amount factoring in a
5% deduction per child off their pre-tax annual salary.  // they will not be paying regular tax anymore!

Ask the user if he/she makes student loan payments, ask how much interest was paid on the
loan last year, and calculate their new tax amount by subtracting the student loan interest from
the pre-tax annual salary (after child deduction).
