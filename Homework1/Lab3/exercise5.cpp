// /*
// A treasure is hidden someplace – the treasures coordinates are (x1, y1)! The coordinates (x1,y1)
// are determined randomly, using the code that is listed at the end of this exercise. The purpose
// of the game is for the Explorer to find the Treasure!
// The explorer is allowed to go North, South, West or East. The Explorer is first positioned at
// location (15,15). If the explorer goes North, only the y coordinate is increased by 1. Similarly, if
// the explorer goes South, the y coordinate is decreased by 1. In the same fashion the x
// coordinate is increased or decreased by 1 depending if the explorer goes East or West,
// respectively.
// Each time the Explorer ‘moves’, the distance between the Explorer and the treasure is
// computed. The formula for the distance between (x,y) and (x1,y1) is distance =
// sqrt(static_cast<double>((x-x1)*(x-x1)+(y-y1)*(y-y1)));
// When the Explorer’s position is the same as the Treasure’s position, the Explorer wins the
// Treasure!

// 1. Ask the user to Please enter direction (n,s,e,w), or x to exit:
// 2. Update the Explorer’s coordinates.
// 3. Calculate and display the distance from the Explorer to the Treasure (this information
// will clue the Explorer to either keep going in the same direction or switch directions).
// 4. At the end of each loop display the Explorer’s coordinates.
// 5. Make sure that you print out how many steps it took to reach the treasure.
// 6. Use the starter code below.
